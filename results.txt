She was eventually placed in an institution, before she ended up in juvenile detention after a violent incident.","While in juvenile detention, Melanie committed another \u201cact of violence\u201d that resulted in the \u201ctragic death of a staff member\u201d, Crawford said.","The commission heard she was found unfit to be tried. In 2011, when her custodial sentence would have elapsed in normal circumstances, Melanie was transferred from prison to a forensic hospital.","A statement provided to the NSW public guardian, Megan Osborne, outlines Melanie\u2019s environment in that period.","Osborne describes two seclusion rooms separated by a courtyard. In her \u201csleeping environment\u201d, there was a hard-moulded bed with a thin mattress and blankets depending on the weather, and an adjoining bathroom with a basin and steel toilet with no toilet seat.","In the second locked room, where she spent the day, there were some posters on the walls, another bed, and Melanie was allowed to listen to music and to watch select television programs at set times according to her routine.","But she could not leave either room, except for an hour on weekdays, or 45 minutes on the weekend.","\u201cThe feeling that I had visiting those seclusion rooms was one that I will never forget and will never leave me,\u201d Osborne said.","Melanie\u2019s lawyer, Helen Seares of the NSW Mental Health Advocacy Service, said authorities had missed several opportunities to help her client before she ended up in juvenile detention.","She recalled first meeting Melanie in 2013. \u201cMelanie at that stage was dressed in a safety smock,\u201d Seares told the commission. \u201cThere was blood on her forehead, which seemed like fresh blood. There was dried blood down the front of her smock. And her room was bare.","\u201cThe thing that stood out to me the most about that room is that Melanie had graffitied the room with her own blood. The smell of dried blood mixed with body odour and the sight of that graffiti is something that will be with me until the day that I die.\u201d","Documents tendered to the commission state that Seares referred Melanie\u2019s case to law firm Maurice Blackburn for a potential compensation claim.","\u201cI didn\u2019t know that I would ever come out of seclusion,\u201d Melanie said in a pre-recorded statement. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018What, I got no light at the end of the tunnel, I don\u2019t see any light, where is the light? God, show me something.\u201d","Gary Forrest, the chief executive of the NSW Justice, Health & Forensic Mental Health Network, told the commission he was upset when he first learned of Melanie\u2019s situation.","He took on the role in 2016.","\u201cThose seclusion rooms are designed for short-term use,\u201d he told the commission. \u201cThey\u2019re not designed for long-term seclusion.\u201d","He would not comment on whether Melanie\u2019s treatment had broken any laws, but acknowledged the relevant policies had not been correctly applied.","Forrest said staff had sought to reduce the time Melanie spent in seclusion from that point onwards, but that it was difficult, in part because they were \u201cquite fearful\u201d of their patient.","\u201cThere were multiple factors that were complicating the ability to be able to get Melanie out of seclusion, so the ideal would have been to do it right at that point in time,\u201d he said.","\u201cBut it was a complex situation for both staff culture as well as staff safety and all of that needed to be addressed before we could get Melanie out of seclusion.\u201d","In November, Melanie was finally moved out of seclusion to a room on a sub-acute ward.","She said in her statement that there was \u201cnot one day my life that I didn\u2019t want to get out and have a life and be happy again on the ward\u201d.","\u201cIt was inhumane to keep someone locked up for that long,\u201d she said.","The counsel assisting the commission, Janice Crawford, said Melanie\u2019s experience and another examined by the inquiry later in the week were \u201cunfortunately not isolated cases\u201d.","The commission also heard the story of Winmartie, the pseudonym given to an Aboriginal man diagnosed with a brain abnormality, who was subjected to \u201csevere treatment while he was in prison, including frequent use of physical, mechanical, and chemical restraints\u201d.","He had killed his sole carer at age 16. Before he arrived at a forensic disability unit, the commission was told that when he became frustrated and began to bang his head, the guard would pin him down, take him to a restraint chair and inject him with a tranquilliser.","\u201cThese cases will be confronting for many,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cThe two individuals have engaged in seriously violent behaviour from time-to-time. Many will be unsympathetic to their plight.","\u201cOthers will be open to trying to understand how each came to be where they are and want to know how we as a society can do better for them.\u201d","The inquiry continues.","In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.
